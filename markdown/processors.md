# Organizing a processor

A processor has a lot of parts and pieces.
It can help keep them orderly if we break them into named components,
similar to naming functions in C.
There are various names used, but one common model is to consider five steps:

1. Fetch, reads an instruction from memory
2. Decode, retrieves values from registers
3. Execute, uses the ALU
4. Memory, reads or writes to one address of memory
5. Writeback, puts results into register

For example, the instruction `pushq %r8`, would

1. Fetch that instruction from memory
2. Detect it is a `push` and read the values of `%r8` and `%rsp` from the register file
3. Compute the new value for `%rsp` by sending `%rsp`'s value and `$-8` into the ALU
4. Send the value of `%r8` to memory to be written at the address `%rsp - $8`
5. Send the new `%rsp` back to the register file

This organization does not change what transistors and wires we actually put on the chip, but it does help us think about what purpose they each serve.



# Pipelining

Real processors *pipeline* instructions:
that is, they split up the work of a single instruction
into several components and divide them up into multiple steps.
And not just as an organizational aid; they add register banks between the steps.

These between-stages registers are called "pipeline registers";
they handle moving instructions one stage at a time.
Because registers require a clock signal to change values,
this means that a single instruction moves from stage to stage across several clock cycles.


{.example ...} Consider the following code

    evaluate:
        xorl    %eax, %eax
        cmpq    $1, %rdi
        je      evaluate_end
        movl    $1, %ecx
    evaluate_loop:
        incq    %rax
        movq    %rdi, %rdx
        sarq    %rdx
        testb   $1, %dil
        leaq    1(%rdi,%rdi,2), %rdi
        cmovneq %rdx, %rdi
        cmpq    %rcx, %rdi
        jne     evaluate_loop
    evaluate_end:
        retq

Three cycles after calling this function,
the state of the processor would look like

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody>
<tr><td colspan="5">
<img src="files/pipeline.svg" style="width:100%"/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">xorl</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">callq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
</tr></tbody></table>

The last stage would presumably still be working on the code that called this function.
{/}

Because an instruction begins working before all previous instructions have finished,
sometimes it is necessary to wait, staying in one stage until an earlier instruction finishes and provides needed data.

{.example ...} Continuing the last example,
the instruction after `je` cannot be loaded until the `cmpq` sets condition codes
and the `je` checks them.
Thus, the next several cycles will look like

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody>
<tr><td colspan="5">
<img src="files/pipeline.svg" style="width:100%"/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">xorl</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">callq</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">xorl</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%" style="text-align:center">movl</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center"></td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The above diagram assumes that `je` can check condition codes 
using the ALU before the preceding `cmpq` has fully finished being executed.
{/}

## Dependencies

A later instruction can depend on an earlier instruction in two ways

1. A *data dependency* occurs when information needed to correctly execute the later instruction is computed by the earlier instruction.

    - The instruction pair `addq %rax, %rcx; addq %rcx, %rdx` has a data dependency: the first computes the `%rcx` value needed by the second.
    - The instruction pair `addq %rax, %rcx; cmovle %r8, %r9` has a data dependency: whether `cmovle` changes `%r9` or not depends on the condition codes set by `addq`.

1. A *control dependency* occurs when the earlier instruction determined whether a later instruction should even be executed.

    - The instruction pair `jle foo; addq %rcx, %rdx` has a control dependency: the second might not be run depending on the result of the first.
    - The instruction `retq` has a control dependency with whatever instruction runs next: which one it is depends on what value `retq` pops off the stack.

The existence of both kinds of dependencies can be determined by inspecting the assembly in a algorithmically-trivial way simply by comparing arguments and icodes.

Dependencies can cause problems in a pipeline, causing na√Øve implementations to compute the wrong result because the earlier instruction will not have completed when the later instruction begins to execute.
Three basic tactics can be used to resolve these issues.

### Stalling

The simplest solution to a dependency is to simply wait for the results to appear.

{.example ...} Continuing the last example,
the instruction after `je` cannot be loaded until the `cmpq` sets condition codes
and the `je` checks them.
Thus, the next several cycles will look like

<img src="files/pipeline.svg" style="width:100%"/>

1. <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*stalled*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">xorl</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">callq</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
    
    We move all current instructions one step down the pipline.
    The first stage does nothing; that is, we set some kind of mux to swap out its usual behavior for a "do nothing" behavior instead.
    That "do nothing" means it puts a `nop` instruction into the next pipleine register.

2. <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*stalled*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">xorl</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
    
    Still not able to decide where to go next.

3. <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*stalled*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">cmpq</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
    
    Still waiting on the `je`.

4. <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*stalled*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">je</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
    
    Still waiting on the `je`.

5. <table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">movl</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
<td width="20%" style="text-align:center">*nop*</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

    The `je` has finally finished! We now know that we *don't* jump (the `cmpq` was comparing `$1` and `%rdi`, an argument we're assuming was not `1`),
    so we fetch the next instruction: `movl $1,%ecx`.
