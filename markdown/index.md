title: Computer Organization and Architecture 2
...

# Overview 

This is our second offering of a course we hope will, along with several other
courses, replace and update several of our current courses.
More information about the pilot of these courses as a whole may be found at
<http://pilot.cs.virginia.edu/>.

For the sake of conversing with those familiar with our other course offerings,
this course covers much of CS 3330 "Computer Architecture" but at a higher level of detail;
the concurrency and security topics from CS 4414 "Operating Systems";
in addition to having several new topics we felt were under-represented in our
previous set of course offerings.

# Learning Outcomes

As a result of taking this course, you should learn

- core system architecture, including DMA, interrupts, and cache coherency
- real hardware, including concurrency complexities and what makes SPECTRE work
- concurrency, including synchronization, mutual exclusion, coherency, and concurrency bugs
- virtual memory, including process isolation and shared memory
- practical networking, including familiarity with TCP/IP, DNS, snooping, spoofing, and TLS
- security, including unix permissions, privilege escalation, and modern exploits
- ethical and legal issues, including reporting
- a build system and practical command-line tools

# Writeups

I have created several writeups for this course:

- [COA2 overview](intro.html)
- [Minimal makefiles](make.html)
- [Kernels -- Software for the Hardware](kernel.html)
- [User Accounts](accounts.html)
- [Buses (and networks)](bus.html)
- [Networking Protocols](protocols.html)
- [Security protocols with less math](sec.html)
- [Caches -- Keep a finger in it](cache.html)
- [Processes and threads](thread.html)
- [Synchronization primitives](sync.html)
- [Using POSIX Threads](pthreads.html)
- [Deadlock](deadlock.html)
- [Consistency](consistency.html)

We will augment these with various examples, online articles, and other resources.
