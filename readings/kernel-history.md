* Corbat√≥, Daggett, and Daley (1962), "[An Experimental Time Sharing System](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1460833.1460871)". Very early paper describing the problem of sharing a machine between multiple users and a very early hardware solution.

* Schroeder and Saltzer (1972), "[A hardware architecture for implementing protection rings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361268.361275)", in _Communications of the ACM_. Describes the equivalent of kernel mode implemented for the influential pre-Unix OS Multics. In this design, the hardware supported not just kernel mode and user mode, but several in between "rings" of protection.
