    When the output below indicates "not yet graded" that means your output did not match
    something the autograder recognized. Usually, this means something is wrong, but we
    will eventually have a human grader look at it to determine what to do.

    If all tests fail/do not run, it may be because:
    <ul><li>you included a `main()` function that interferes with our testing code,
    <li>you did not define both `getoutput` and `parallelgetoutput` so our testing code will link successfully, or
    <li>your code crashes due to a memory error (see section 3.1 of the assignment for advice on checking for this locally)
    <li><small><i>[added 23 Feb:]</i></small> our testing code has trouble free()ing what you return
    </ul>
    <p>
    <small><i>[added 23 Feb:]</i></small> Memory errors reported below can include issues related to our testing code outputting what you return (in which case they make indicate a line number in your code related to the allocation you return).

    Selected notes on interpreting our testing output below <small>(updated 1 Oct)</small>:
    <ul>
    <li>our tests use <tt>ptbr</tt> to inspect the page table contents and require the page table entries use the format specified in the assignment (including valid bits and the placement of physical page numbers)
    <li>the memory posix_memalign allocates may be initialized differently in our test environment than your environment (posix_memalign is not required to zero out the memory it returns)
    <li>the expected results of tests of translate() are based on which page table entries map to valid allocations, not on what page_allocate calls were made previously, so if your page table is formatted differently than we expect, they make require

    Selected notes on interpreting our testing output below:
    <ul>
    <li>the "reallocation" test calls page_allocate twice for the same address</li>
    <li>tests that count how many pages are allocated are counting calls to posix_memalign</li>
    <li>when looking for "allocated page table entries" or "non-allocated page table entries", the tests are looking at the indices it thinks should be allocated based on its calls to page_allocate(). So you could fail these tests both because of computing the indices wrong or because the page table entry content is not what we expect</li>
    <li>tests that check that allocations are "page sized" check both the total bytes allocated and that the allocation starts at the beginning of a page rather than spanning multiple pages</li>
    <li>some tests check that prior allocations still work (with translate()) after more calls to page_allocate() (for other pages)</li>
    <li>if the tests fail to completely run, this may be because the tests tried to dereference a value returned by translate() which was an invalid pointer, or because your code segfaulted. If you're worried that your code might segfault, I'd suggest using <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jh2jf/courses/cs2130/fall2022/readings/memory.html#detecting-and-avoiding-bugs">AddressSanitizer</a> (along with your own tests) to try to find memory errors in your code. (AddressSanitizer can detect many errors consistently when they may only sometimes cause segfaults.)</li>

    Selected notes on tests:
    <ul><li>The testing scripts call tlb_clear() in between groups of tests, so if your tlb_clear() doesn't really reset everything that could cause apparently unrelated tests to fail.
    <li>If you're failing the "correct sequence of translate() calls" test, this could be because you call translate() too many/few times in some cases,
        or because you evict the wrong entry sometimes.
