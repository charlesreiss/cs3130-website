# Logistics

We encourage group work with "buddy programming"..

Buddy programming is when

- You each create your own code
- You share development, looking at one another's work and so on
- You catch each other up if one is behind or stuck

# Task

We provide a threaded implementation of the [Dining Philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).
This is a famous, if somewhat contrived, example of deadlock.
You'll modify it to not have deadlock.
We give three approaches to this; you'll need to do at least one, and we encourage doing a second if you still have time in the lab to do so.

## Deadlocking code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pthread_t philosopher[5];
pthread_mutex_t chopstick[5];

void *eat(void *arg) {
    int n = (int) (long)arg;
    // take two chopsticks
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopstick[n]);
    printf("Philosopher %d got chopstick %d\n", n, n);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&chopstick[(n+1)%5]);
    printf("Philosopher %d got chopstick %d\n", n, (n+1)%5);
    
    printf ("Philosopher %d is eating\n",n);
    sleep(1);
    
    // set them back down
    printf("Philosopher %d set down chopstick %d\n", n, (n+1)%5);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&chopstick[(n+1)%5]);
    printf("Philosopher %d set down chopstick %d\n", n, n);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&chopstick[n]);
    return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i += 1)
        pthread_mutex_init(&chopstick[i], NULL);

    for(int i =0; i < 5; i += 1)
        pthread_create(&philosopher[i], NULL, eat, (void *)(size_t)i);

    for(int i=0; i < 5; i += 1)
        pthread_join(philosopher[i], NULL);

    for(int i=0; i < 5; i += 1)
        pthread_mutex_destroy(&chopstick[i]);

    return 0;
}
```

This can be run as

```bash
clang -O2 -lpthread dp.c && ./a.out`
```

Because thread scheduling is somewhat random in practice, you may need to run the program several times in a row to see a deadlock.

To help idenitfy deadlocks and other synchronization problems more reliably,
we strongly recommend using ThreadSanitizer:

```bash
clang -O2 -lpthread -fsanitize=thread dp.c && ./a.out`
```

This will run slower (though not noticably so for this program), but tries to idenitfy cases where
the program does not implement a resource hierarchy strategy. It also will (with varying
reliablity) detect several other kinds of thread usage errors (like race conditions).

## Required approach: Arbitrator

Ensure there is no deadlock
by using the [Arbitrator solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem#Arbitrator_solution).
A correct solution can be just four lines:

1. declare a global arbitrator mutex
2. initialize that mutex in `main`
3. lock it and
4. unlock it, both in `eat`, so that only one philosopher can reach for chopsticks at a time

(This is not one of the deadlock prevention strategies we discussed in lecture, but it makes the thread take turns waiting for resources (the chopsticks), so only one thread can wait at a time. With only one thread waiting at a time, we can't have a cyclic dependency.)

If correctly implemented,

- There will be no deadlock; the program will always terminate
- The output will never have two "Philosopher *i* got chopstick" lines with a different "Philosopher *j* got chopstick" line in between


## Extra approach 1: Resource hierarchy

This implementation should ensure there is no deadlock
by using the [Resource hierarch solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem#Resource_hierarchy_solution).

Require every philosopher to pick up their lower-numbered chopstick before their higher-numbered chopstick.

If correctly implemented,

- There will be no deadlock; the program will always terminate
- The output will never have two "Philosopher *i* got chopstick *j*" line following a different "Philosopher *i* got chopstick *k*" line unless *j* < *k*.


## Extra approach 2: Message passing

This implementation should ensure there is no deadlock
by using the [Chandy/Misra solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem#Chandy/Misra_solution).

You'll probably need to add some kind of data structure to keep track of who owns which chopstick and which chopsticks are dirty,
as well as functions to handle requesting chopsticks.

This is definitely more involved than the other two files,
but also will give you a better understanding of how to use pthreads' mutex objects to solve non-trivial problems.

If correctly implemented,

- There will be no deadlock; the program will always terminate
- Philosopher 0 will always eat without waiting, starting with both chopstick 0 and chopstick *n* âˆ’ 1 (where *n* is the number of philosophers).

# Check off

Either:
*  submit solutions including at least one of the extra approaches to the submission site
   * submit separate files for each approach.
   * use the filenames `dp-arb.c`, `dp-rh.c`, and/or `dp-mp.c`.
*  OR have a TA see your program working.
   They may ask to see your code and ask a questions along the lines of "why this line here instead of there?" which all team members should be prepared to answer.
