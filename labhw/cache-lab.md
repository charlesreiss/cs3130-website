# Your Task

1.  Answer the questions at the [lab interface](https://kytos02.cs.virginia.edu/cs3130-spring2023/cachelab.php).

    Each person should answer an individual set of questions, but you may work with others to figure how to do
    so.


# Hints

In addition to the cache slides/lecture recordings in general, you may find helpful:

*  diagram on [slide 40 (PDF page 57) from 14 March 2023](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cr4bd/3130/S2023/slides/20230314-slides.pdf#page=57)

*  formulas on [slide 49 (PDF page 69) from 14 March 2023](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cr4bd/3130/S2023/slides/20230314-slides.pdf#page=69)
