...

1.  Answer the questions at the [lab interface](https://kytos02.cs.virginia.edu/cs3130-spring2023/cachelab.php).

    Each person should answer an individual set of questions, but you may work with others to figure how to do
    so.

    (If you have correctly completed the exercises on the lab interface, that counts
    as submitting the lab and you do not need to get checked off.)
