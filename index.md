# Readings

We have created several writeups for this course:

- [CSO2 overview](readings/intro.html)
- [Minimal makefiles](readings/make.html)
- [Kernels -- Software for the Hardware](readings/kernel.html)
- [User Accounts](readings/accounts.html)
- [Buses (and networks)](readings/bus.html)
- [Networking Protocols](readings/protocols.html)
- [Security protocols with less math](readings/sec.html)
- [Caches -- Keep a finger in it](readings/cache.html)
- [Processes and threads](readings/thread.html)
- [Synchronization primitives](readings/sync.html)
- [Using POSIX Threads](readings/pthreads.html)

(The original version of these was written by Professor Tychonievich.)

We will augment these with various examples, online articles, and other resources.
